He holds the seat with a small majority, but finds the demands of his career at odds with his left-wing convictions.\n\nScreened for one series of eleven episodes, Bill Brand starred Jack Shepherd in the title role. Other notable cast members included: Lynn Farleigh, Alan Badel, Rosemary Frankau, Arthur Lowe, Rosemary Martin, Cherie Lunghi, Geoffrey Palmer, Nigel Hawthorne and Colin Jeavons.\n\nOf these, Lowe played the Prime Minister, Arthur Watson. Badel played a left-wing Cabinet minister, David Last. Palmer and Hawthorne played Government ministers from the Gaitskellite wing of the Labour Party. Cherie Lunghi played Alex, a young woman with whom Brand is having an extra-marital affair. Trevor Griffiths was strongly criticised for giving Lunghi's character the same name as a well-known former Rangers F.C. footballer: Rangers supporters felt that Griffiths was deliberately baiting them.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"/xgzELxaKiX3IViCNRxiZjlLr2Sp.jpg","popularity":1.0081,"name":"Bill Brand","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"media_type":"tv"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/1MQ7iXiJQA2GZRoospinMo9lCwY.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":108540,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Bill W.","overview":"William G.

With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that made him an icon within A.A., but also an alcoholic unable to be a member of the very society he had created. A reluctant hero, Bill Wilson lived a life of sacrifice and service, and left a legacy that continues every day, all around the world.","release_date":"2012-05-18","poster_path":"/AqFoDRXdsR4anzYMyGaGFn77hjU.jpg","popularity":1.001962,"title":"Bill W.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"media_type":"movie"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[],"id":143495,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Bill and Tony","overview":"Experimental film by William S.

Unlike the previous show, however, guests are usually more well-versed in the subject matter: more experts such as journalists, professors and politicians participate in the panel, and there are fewer actors and celebrities included in it. Additionally, many guests appear via satellite. Also, Politically Incorrect was produced four days a week and was pre-recorded, while Real Time only produces one episode a week which is broadcast live.\n\nReal Time is an hour-long program with a studio audience, airing live on Friday nights at 10:00 PM. It originates from Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Prior to 2009, approximately 12 new weekly episodes aired in the spring, followed by another such set of new episodes in the fall. In 2009, the show began airing as one continuous season. Because of the live, current-events nature of the show, HBO does not re-air old episodes between breaks, though occasionally a repeat will be shown when the program takes a week off during the season.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"/nx4vS7Oq0OGjAaINSyGZRkKuosf.jpg","popularity":2.29412,"name":"Real Time with Bill Maher","vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6,"media_type":"tv"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[16],"id":265706,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Action Bill","overview":"William Shatner, in a time traveling robot, attempts to destroy William Shakespeare but underestimates the fighting prowess of Action Bill.a","release_date":"2014-04-06","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.004929,"title":"Action Bill","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":1,"media_type":"movie"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/yAxEIBjra2GwpsF300tgJHJt0r3.jpg","genre_ids":[99,10402],"id":55063,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Still Bill","overview":"STILL BILL is an intimate portrait of soul legend Bill Withers, best known for his classics “Ain’t No Sunshine,” “Lean On Me,” “Lovely Day,” “Grandma’s Hands,” and “Just the Two of Us.” With his soulful delivery and warm, heartfelt sincerity, Withers has written the songs that have – and always will – resonate deeply within the fabric of our times.
