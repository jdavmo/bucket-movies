Nevertheless, the show had a major influence on popular culture and it became a cult classic in broadcast syndication during the 1970s. The show eventually spawned a franchise, consisting of five additional television series, 12 theatrical films, and numerous books, games, toys, and other products.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"/3ATqzWYDbWOV2RBLWNwA43InT60.jpg","popularity":2.893463,"name":"Star Trek","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":42,"media_type":"tv"},{"backdrop_path":"/zIZwRctxH5aFfRNIF8DU0mC2png.jpg","first_air_date":"1964-09-24","genre_ids":[10765,18,35],"id":1712,"original_language":"en","original_name":"The Munsters","overview":"The Munsters is an American television sitcom depicting the home life of a family of benign monsters.
