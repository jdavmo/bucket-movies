Although this television series had the title of Star Trek, it later acquired the retronym of Star Trek: The Original Series to distinguish the show within the media franchise that it began. Star Trek's Nielsen ratings while on NBC were low, and the network canceled it after three seasons and 79 episodes. Nevertheless, the show had a major influence on popular culture and it became a cult classic in broadcast syndication during the 1970s. The show eventually spawned a franchise, consisting of five additional television series, 12 theatrical films, and numerous books, games, toys, and other products.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"/3ATqzWYDbWOV2RBLWNwA43InT60.jpg","popularity":2.893463,"name":"Star Trek","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":42,"media_type":"tv"},{"backdrop_path":"/zIZwRctxH5aFfRNIF8DU0mC2png.jpg","first_air_date":"1964-09-24","genre_ids":[10765,18,35],"id":1712,"original_language":"en","original_name":"The Munsters","overview":"The Munsters is an American television sitcom depicting the home life of a family of benign monsters.
