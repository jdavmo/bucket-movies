It is about family bonds, about human altruism, dignity and courage. Also about cruelty and the holocaust, a tribute to the Jews that suffered and to the non-Jews who were willing to risk their own lives to help them.\n\nThe acting is generally outstanding, as is the filming and the music. Attention to historical detail is exquisite (clothes, decors, culture…).\n\nThe script departs substantially from Rybakov's novel, on which the film is based, bringing in some different characters and scenes. I guess this was partly unavoidable, because of the novel's narrative approach, compared to the need for dialogues in the film, which had to be made up.\n\nThe series is, in my opinion, not without flaws. It combines some truly moving scenes with others that left me wondering what the point was, and thinking that 16 episodes were not needed after all. Although the characters' complexity rings true, some of the scenes seem implausible. Plus the 2 main characters hardly age throughout the film, everybody speaks Russian everywhere… While the film captures much of the spirit of the book, it is weaker in many respects, including in its portrayal of Jewish suffering. Needless to say, I preferred the book, but this is almost always so. Provided you are not looking for 100% accurate history, nor 100% Rybakov's novel you may, like me, be left with a very positive overall impression.\n\n(From IMDB: juan_palmero65@yahoo.fr)","origin_country":[],"poster_path":"/zRSbKmtzcBVI3AyhpBAwCYj3hqF.jpg","popularity":1.003604,"name":"Heavy Sand","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"media_type":"tv"},{"backdrop_path":null,"first_air_date":"1995-01-09","genre_ids":[18],"id":14527,"original_language":"ko","original_name":"모래時計","overview":"Sandglass is a South Korean television series considered one of the most significant and highest-rated Korean dramas in history.
