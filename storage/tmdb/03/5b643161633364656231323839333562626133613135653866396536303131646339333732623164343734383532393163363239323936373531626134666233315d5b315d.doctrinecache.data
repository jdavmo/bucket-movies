The energy, compassion, and heat of township life in all its elements create a constantly visually interesting and dynamic background for the unfolding of the story, which owes part of its huge popularity to the thrilling combination of a violent gangster tale with a passionate, almost supernatural love story.

Bizet's opera, based on Prosper Merimée's novel, premiered in Paris on March 3, 1875.
