The programme originated from a one-off drama, entitled Woodentop, which was broadcast in August 1983. In its final year on air, The Bill was broadcast once a week, usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays, in a one-hour format. The programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of police officers, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. At the time of the series' conclusion, The Bill was the longest-running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom, and was among the longest-running of any British television series. The series was produced by Thames Television. The series name originated from \"Old Bill\", a slang term for the police. This was also Geoff McQueen's original title idea for the series, before he eventually decided on \"The Bill\".\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed amongst fans and critics alike, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis, and another episode in the same year resulted in litigation, submitted by MP George Galloway for defamation. The series has also faced more general criticism, concerning the levels of violence it portrays, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a pre-watershed slot. During its time on air, The Bill won several awards, including BAFTAs, a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award and the title of \"best drama\" at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009, the latter being the series' fourth consecutive win. Throughout its twenty-seven-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including UKTV Gold, Alibi, Watch and UKTV G2. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission The Bill, and that filming on the series would cease on 14 June 2010. The last ever episode of the series was aired on 31 August 2010.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"/3Pa3nrW5oxkmWI0cdunbqFaEcdo.jpg","popularity":1.056567,"name":"The Bill","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"media_type":"tv"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/33WfP01Pu8SMuuHYnoJXMRCMtmI.jpg","genre_ids":[28,80,53],"id":393,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Kill Bill: Vol. 2","overview":"The Bride unwaveringly continues on her \"roaring rampage of revenge\" against the band of assassins who had tried to kill her and her unborn child.

The show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle-class African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nAccording to TV Guide, the show \"was TV's biggest hit in the 1980s, and almost single-handedly revived the sitcom genre and NBC's ratings fortunes\". Originally, the show had been pitched to ABC, which rejected it. Entertainment Weekly stated that The Cosby Show helped to make possible a larger variety of shows based on people of African descent, from In Living Color to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The Cosby Show was based on comedy routines in Cosby's standup act, which were based on his family life. Other sitcoms, such as Home Improvement and Everybody Loves Raymond, would later follow that pattern. The show spawned the spin-off A Different World, which ran for six seasons from 1987 to 1993.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"/kVdlCChalmTXXiG1JX8vP9x2wzg.jpg","popularity":2.241282,"name":"The Cosby Show","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":8,"media_type":"tv"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/3ro0XIhzL8dqUjx5wcWQORHR51o.jpg","genre_ids":[],"id":381186,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Bill Brand","overview":"Trevor Griffiths' epic story that charted the political progress through the 1970s of the eponymous Brand, a Labour Party Member of Parliament who is selected as Labour candidate for a Lancashire textile constituency, following the death of the sitting Labour MP.
